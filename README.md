# Rend

A fully functioning compiler built from scratch to explore modern programming language design and implementation in C++.

## Goal

This project is an experiment in building a programming language and its compiler from the ground up using C++. The focus is understanding compiler structure, abstract syntax tree design, parsing techniques, semantic analysis, code generation and error recovery.
To create a working programming language quickly, I will leverage the C runtime for tasks like heap allocation and file I/O. I might implement custom versions of these functionalities in the future.

## AI

I only use Github Copilot for minor code snippets, documentation and repetitive tasks. No core logic or complex algorithms are AI-generated. I do use Gemini specifically for brainstorming and design discussions when I don't know how to approach a problem or if I feel like my approach is not optimal.
