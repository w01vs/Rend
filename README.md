# Intro

This is my attempt at making a compiled programming language. It will compile directly to nasm assembly x86-64. It will run on Linux. To get to a working programming language faster, I will likely use the C runtime internally to handle things suchs as heap allocation and file IO, at least for the foreseeable future. I might write my own versions of these functionalities at some point.
